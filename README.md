# CougarAI (Legacy Version)

This was my first major Java project created during ICSE Class 10. 
It started as a simple 2D-array chatbot and evolved into a file-searching bot.

### Status: Open for Contribution
I am currently focusing on my board exams and am no longer actively 
maintaining this project. I've left it here for anyone who wants to:
* Upgrade it to use the Gemini AI API.
* Add web-scraping capabilities using Jsoup.
* Improve the search algorithm.

Feel free to fork this repo and make it your own!
*PLEASE MAINTAIN AND SAFEGUARD THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPRISATORY AND DO NO SUE ME OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO HAS WORKED FOR THIS PROJECT*

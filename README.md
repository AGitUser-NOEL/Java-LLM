Might be this is a long term version of CougarAI, this can be the final update.
this is now running on Gemini and Jsoup.
I dont think this can be made better because its based on java and it has limited featutres.
If its not running properly or it has errors you can configure it by yourself by changing file structure and making changes to the program.
